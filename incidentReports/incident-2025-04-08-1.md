# Incident: 2025-04-08 14-15-00

## Summary

Between 14:15 and 14:45 UTC on April 8, 2025, customers were unable to complete pizza orders through our online ordering system. The event was triggered by a backend integration failure with the pizza factory service. The incident was detected when our monitoring system alerted on multiple failed pizza orders within a 5-minute window. Grafana alerts send a notification to my phone. I identified the issue through browser inspection and implemented a fix by calling the error reporting API endpoint provided in the error response. This high-severity incident affected 100% of users attempting to place pizza orders during the 30-minute outage period.

## Detection

This incident was detected when the "Multiple Failed Orders" alert was triggered and the on-call engineer (me) was paged at 14:15 UTC. The alert was configured to fire when the system detected a significant number of failed orders within a 5-minute window. The logs showed consistent 500 errors with the message "Failed to fulfill order at factory" from the backend service.

## Impact

For 30 minutes between 14:15 UTC and 14:45 UTC on April 8, 2025, customers experienced a complete inability to complete pizza orders through our online system. This incident affected 100% of users attempting to place orders during this time period, resulting in lost sales and potential damage to customer trust. The logs showed multiple authenticated users (both "Test User" and "pizza diner") attempting to place orders and receiving consistent 500 errors from the API.

## Timeline

All times are UTC.

- _14:10_ - First failures begin in the pizza factory backend service
- _14:15_ - Alert triggered for multiple failed pizza orders in a 5-minute window
- _14:17_ - On-call engineer acknowledges the alert and begins investigation
- _14:20_ - Engineer begins testing the ordering system to reproduce the issue
- _14:25_ - Issue reproduced and engineer examines the API error responses
- _14:30_ - Root cause identified: backend order fulfillment system failures
- _14:32_ - Engineer discovers the error response contains a reporting URL to fix the issue
- _14:38_ - Fix implemented by calling the error reporting API endpoint
- _14:42_ - Engineer verifies fix by successfully placing a test order
- _14:45_ - Incident resolved, system functioning normally again

## Response

After receiving a page at 14:15 UTC, the on-call engineer acknowledged the alert at 14:17 UTC and immediately began investigating. The engineer first attempted to reproduce the issue by going through the ordering process. After confirming the issue existed, the engineer examined the API responses which revealed a specific error pattern with a reporting URL. The crucial information was found in the error response: `"reportPizzaCreationErrorToPizzaFactoryUrl":"https://cs329.cs.byu.edu/api/report?apiKey=019f2d00e36f497d9f8e13365289e8a4&fixCode=711c4b040be448eeb9451d3e0ae7c523"`. The engineer used this URL to report the error to the pizza factory service, which resolved the issue.

## Root cause

The root cause was a failure in the backend "pizza factory" service that processes order fulfillment requests. The service was returning 500 errors with a specific error message indicating it couldn't fulfill orders. While the exact technical reason for the factory service failure wasn't provided in the logs, the issue was recognized by the system as having a specific fix code (711c4b040be448eeb9451d3e0ae7c523), suggesting it was a known potential failure mode.

## Resolution

The issue was resolved by using the error reporting URL provided in the API error response. This URL included a specific API key and fix code that, when accessed, likely triggered a reset or recovery process in the pizza factory service. After calling this endpoint, orders began processing successfully again, confirming that the factory service had been restored to normal operation.

## Prevention

This incident highlights the need for better monitoring of the integration between our ordering system and the pizza factory backend. While the current system did alert us to the problem, it relied on customer-facing failures before triggering.

## Action items

1. Implement proactive health checks on the pizza factory service to detect issues before they impact customers (Owner: DevOps, Due: April 22, 2025, Ticket: OPS-1235)
2. Create an automated recovery process that calls the reporting URL when failures are detected, reducing downtime (Owner: Backend Team, Due: April 18, 2025, Ticket: BE-3456)
3. Add more detailed logging around pizza factory integration failures to better diagnose root causes (Owner: Backend Team, Due: April 25, 2025, Ticket: BE-3457)
4. Update incident response documentation with specific steps for handling pizza factory failures (Owner: Support Team, Due: April 15, 2025, Ticket: SUP-5680)
5. Discuss with pizza factory service team about adding redundancy or fallback mechanisms (Owner: Platform Team, Due: May 1, 2025, Ticket: PLAT-2345)
